# Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp

## About This Repository

This repository documents my complete journey through the **"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp"** on Udemy. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio of the skills, projects, and exercises I completed, covering a wide range of topics from basic Python programming to advanced machine learning and big data concepts.

Each numbered folder corresponds to a section of the course and contains the Jupyter Notebooks with detailed code, explanations, and practical applications.

## Course Curriculum & Projects

The bootcamp is structured to build a strong foundation and progressively tackle more complex topics. Below is the outline of the sections covered in this repository.

### Part 1: Python and Data Analysis Foundations
* **00 - Python Crash Course:** A fast-paced refresher on Python fundamentals.
* **01 - NumPy for Data Analysis:** Mastering numerical operations with NumPy arrays.
* **02 - Pandas for Data Analysis:** In-depth data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.
* **03 - Matplotlib for Data Visualization:** Creating a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **04 - Seaborn for Data Visualization:** Building beautiful statistical data visualizations.
* **05 - Data Capstone Projects:** Applying data analysis and visualization skills to real-world datasets.

### Part 2: Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn
* **07 - Linear Regression:** Predicting continuous values.
* **08 - Cross-Validation and Bias-Variance Trade-Off:** Techniques for creating robust and generalized models.
* **09 - Logistic Regression:** Building classification models.
* **10 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric classification and regression method.
* **11 - Decision Trees and Random Forests:** Using tree-based models for high-accuracy predictions.
* **12 - Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A powerful supervised learning model for classification.
* **13 - K-Means Clustering:** An unsupervised learning technique for finding patterns and clusters in data.
* **14 - Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A dimensionality reduction technique.

### Part 3: Advanced Data Science Topics
* **15 - Recommender Systems:** Building systems that predict user preferences (e.g., movie recommendations).
* **16 - Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Working with and analyzing text data.
* **17 - Big Data and Spark with PySpark:** Scaling up data analysis to handle massive datasets with Apache Spark.
* **18 - Neural Nets and Deep Learning:** An introduction to TensorFlow and the fundamentals of building neural networks.
